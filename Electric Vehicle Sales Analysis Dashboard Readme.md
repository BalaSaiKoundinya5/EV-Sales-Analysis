1. **Environmental Impact:** Evaluate the environmental benefits of electric vehicle adoption, such as reductions in carbon emissions.
1. **Policy Analysis:** Monitor the effectiveness of state policies and incentives designed to promote EV adoption.
1. **Market Segmentation:** Understand the demographics and preferences of EV owners to inform future market strategies.

**Data Source**

The dataset includes information from various sources such as government records, vehicle registration data, and infrastructure databases, covering details like:

- **Vehicle Registration Data:** Information on the number of registered EVs, categorized by type, model, and year
- **Charging Station Data:** Locations, types, and usage statistics of public and private charging stations
- **Environmental Data:** Metrics on carbon emissions reductions and energy consumption from EV usage
- **Policy Data:** Records of state incentives, subsidies, and regulations aimed at promoting EV adoption
- **Demographic Data:** Information on EV owners, including age, income, and geographic location
